# Permutation-Combination-Calculator
This program allows the user to calculate permutations and combinations. The program will prompt the user to choose which formula to use, to enter integers for both number of elements (n) and number of subsets (r), and whether the user would like to continue using another formula or end the program. The final calculation will be outputted. 

The following formulas are to be incorporated:
  (1) Permutation of Selected Elements: n!/(n - r)!, 
  (2) Permutations with Sets of Indistinguishable Objects: n!/[(n1!)(n2!)(n3!)...(nk!)], 
  (3) Combinations of Counting Subsets of a Set: n!/[r!(n - r)!], 
  (4) Combinations of Counting Subsets of a Set with Repetition: 
        (r + n - 1) 
            (r)
